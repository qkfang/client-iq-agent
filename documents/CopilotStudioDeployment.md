10. Select the connected Fabric data agent. Under additional details, you can optionally decide the authentication of the Fabric data agent to be the User authentication or Agent author authentication. If you select User authentication as the authentication, you need to ensure that users have access to the Fabric data agent and its underlying data sources.
