# Generate Custom Data

## Run the AI Generator
```bash
az login
```

> **VS Code Web users:** Use `az login --use-device-code` since browser-based login is not supported in VS Code Web.

Override `.env` settings directly from the command line:
```bash
python scripts/00_build_solution.py --clean --industry "Insurance" --usecase "Property insurance with claims processing and policy management"
```

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--clean` | Reset Fabric artifacts (required when switching scenarios) |

### Alternative: update .env configuration
With your `.env` configured, generate customer-specific data:

```bash
python scripts/00_build_solution.py --clean
```

## Generation Process

============================================================
Generating Custom Data with AI
============================================================

Industry: Insurance
Use Case: Property insurance with claims processing and policy management

[1/4] Generating ontology configuration...
  → Analyzing use case for entities and relationships
  → Created: Policies, Claims, Customers, Agents
  → Defined: 6 relationships, 4 business rules
  ✓ ontology_config.json

[2/4] Generating structured data (CSV)...
  → policies.csv (16 rows) — Policy details, coverage, premiums
  → claims.csv (40 rows) — Claim status, amounts, dates
  → customers.csv (20 rows) — Policyholder information
  → agents.csv (8 rows) — Agent assignments
  ✓ 4 CSV files generated

[3/4] Generating documents (PDF)...
  → claims_process.pdf — How to file and process claims
  → coverage_guide.pdf — Policy coverage explanations
  → underwriting_policy.pdf — Risk assessment guidelines
  ✓ 3 documents generated

[4/4] Generating sample questions...
  → 15 sample questions spanning data, documents, and combined
  ✓ sample_questions.txt

============================================================
Data generated: data/20260202_143022_insurance/
============================================================
```

## Review Generated Content

Check what was created:

```bash
# View the generated files
ls data/*/

# Read sample questions for testing
cat data/*/config/sample_questions.txt
```

### Sample Questions (Insurance Example)

```
# Structured data questions (Fabric IQ)
How many open claims do we have?
What's the total value of claims filed this month?
Which agents have the most policies?

# Unstructured data questions (Foundry IQ)
What's our process for filing a property claim?
What does our standard homeowner policy cover?
What are our underwriting criteria for high-risk properties?

# Combined questions (Both)
Which open claims are approaching our SLA deadline based on our process guidelines?
Do any current claims involve coverage types not in our standard policy?
```

## Expected Output

The complete build takes ~5 minutes:

```

## Troubleshooting

### AI generation times out

- Check your internet connection
- Try with `--size small` for faster generation
- Verify Azure AI Services quota

### Fabric errors on --clean

- Ensure `--fabric-workspace-id` was passed correctly (or `FABRIC_WORKSPACE_ID` is set)
- Check you have Contributor access to the workspace
- Wait a minute and retry (Fabric operations can be slow)
