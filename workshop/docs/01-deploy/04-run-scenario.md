# Build solution

## Run the Full Pipeline

One command builds the solution including data processing and agent creation:

Fabric Workspace Mode

```bash
python scripts/00_build_solution.py --from 02 --fabric-workspace-id <your-workspace-id>
```

> **Note:** If you omit `--fabric-workspace-id`, the script will prompt you for it interactively. Press **Enter** key to start or **Ctrl+C** to cancel the process.

Azure Only Mode (if you ran `azd env set AZURE_ENV_ONLY true` before deploying)
```bash
python scripts/00_build_solution.py --from 03
```

> **Note:** Press **Enter** key to start or **Ctrl+C** to cancel the process.

This uses the `data/default` folder and runs all setup steps:

| Step | What Happens | Time |
|------|--------------|------|
| 02 | Create Fabric Lakehouse & Load data | ~1.5min |
| 03 | Generate Agent Prompt | ~5s |
| 05 | Upload documents to AI Search | ~1min |
| 06 | Create Foundry Agent | ~10s |

## Expected Output

```
> [02] Create Fabric Lakehouse & Load Data... OK (90.5s)
> [03] Generate Agent Prompt... OK (5.2s)
> [05] Upload to AI Search... OK (60.3s)
> [06] Create Foundry Agent... OK (10.1s)

> ✓ Done! 4/4 steps completed
> Next: python scripts/07_test_agent.py
```

<!-- ## Create the Ontology

Before testing the Fabric Data Agent, set up an Ontology in Microsoft Fabric for your scenario.

Follow the step-by-step guide: **[Create Ontology](05-ontology-creation.md)** to set up the default use case. -->

This sets up entity types (Tickets, Inspections), data bindings from your Lakehouse tables, and relationships between them.

## Test the Fabric Data Agent
1. Go to your [Microsoft Fabric](https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/) workspace
2. Copy the Ontology name from your workspace
3. Select "New item" 
4. Search for and select "Data Agent" 
5. Select add data source and search & select your Ontology resource created in the previous step. 
6. Select Agent instructions and paste the below instructions. 
```

```

> Note: The Ontology set up may take up to 15 minutes so retry after some time if you don't see good responses. 

## Test the Agent

```bash
python scripts/07_test_agent.py
```

You: What is the average score from inspections?

Agent: The average score from inspections is **77**.

You: What constitutes a failed inspection?

Agent: A failed inspection is defined by the following criteria:

1. **Score Requirement**: All inspections must achieve a minimum score of 80 out of 100.
2. **Follow-up Actions**: Inspections falling below this threshold will require immediate review and corrective action, along with follow-up assessments within 48 hours.

Teams must document all corrective actions taken.

You: Do any inspections violate quality control standards in our Inspection Procedures?

Agent: Yes, there are several inspections that violate the quality control standards as they scored below the required minimum of 80. Here are the details:

| Inspection ID  | Customer Name | Result | Score |
|----------------|---------------|--------|-------|
| INSPECTION002  | Customer 4    | Pass   | 65    |
| INSPECTION009  | Customer 10   | Pass   | 60    |
| INSPECTION010  | Customer 5    | Pass   | 71    |
| INSPECTION011  | Customer 6    | Pass   | 74    |
| INSPECTION012  | Customer 1    | Fail   | 69    |
| INSPECTION013  | Customer 15   | Pass   | 69    |
| INSPECTION016  | Customer 10   | Pass   | 64    |
| INSPECTION019  | Customer 11   | Pass   | 73    |
| INSPECTION020  | Customer 6    | Pass   | 72    |
| INSPECTION022  | Customer 2    | Pass   | 62    |
| INSPECTION024  | Customer 7    | Fail   | 70    |
| INSPECTION026  | Customer 3    | Pass   | 67    |
| INSPECTION027  | Customer 5    | Pass   | 69    |
| INSPECTION028  | Customer 8    | Pass   | 62    |
| INSPECTION029  | Customer 10   | Pass   | 75    |
| INSPECTION030  | Customer 11   | Pass   | 60    |
| INSPECTION031  | Customer 8    | Pass   | 60    |
| INSPECTION032  | Customer 3    | Pass   | 62    |
| INSPECTION033  | Customer 2    | Pass   | 68    |
| INSPECTION036  | Customer 15   | Pass   | 62    |
| INSPECTION037  | Customer 3    | Pass   | 67    |
| INSPECTION040  | Customer 4    | Pass   | 74    |

These inspections need to be reviewed and may require corrective actions.
